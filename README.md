Gamify your slack tasks! ðŸ’»


A lot of teams use Slack to get things done. However when you have ton of things to do with no short term rewards in sight, it gets difficult to check off those tasks. That's where SlackPoint comes to the rescue! SlackPoint aims to make work more fun and get people motivated to finish their tasks by gamifying Slack!



### How the Hell do you use this?

List of miracles that slackpoint can performâœ¨:

* Create a new task
* Mark task as done
* View pending tasks
* View completed tasks
* Ask for help

lets go over these one by one...

#### **1. Create new task:**

You can create a new task by simple using the ``/create-task`` command. We ask for just a few more parameters in addition to that:



Command: ``/create -d [description of task] -p [points of the task] -ddl [deadline of the task]``

Example:
``/create -d Hey! This is my new task -p 100 -ddl 15/10/2022``

This particular command will create a new task with the description as ``Hey! This is my new task`` having ``100`` points and a deadline of ``15th October 2022``

#### **2. Mark task as done:**

Here you can mark a task as completed. You just need to give the task ID as a parameter

Command: ``/task-done [task ID]``

Example:
``/task-done 10214``

This will mark the task having task ID ``10214`` as completed. Further, updates records to show that this task is completed by user who posted this command

#### **3. View pending tasks:**

This command will return the list of incomplete tasks. Relax! no parameters required here

Command: ``/viewpending [no parameters]``

![View pending GIF](https://i.imgur.com/TAnNoSO.gif)

Above command will display a list of pending tasks

#### **4. View completed tasks:**

Like the above command this will return a list of completed tasks. No parameters here as well!

Command: ``/viewcompleted [no parameter]``

![View completed GIF](https://i.imgur.com/3SFQU2N.gif)

Above command will display a list of completed tasks

#### **5. Leaderboard:**

Want to get competitive? Take a peek at the leaderboard and try to beat the winner!

Command: ``/leaderboard [no parameters]``

It displays the list of the top performers on the channel along with their points.

#### **6. Help:**

Newbie at using slackpoint? You could use some help...

Command: ``/help [no parameters]``

### RoachPack

Heyy! We are a group of Graduate students at NC State University, or to be more specific, we are dreamers who want to be pioneers of the Computer Science world.
Consider this homework to be one of our many steps at achieving our dreams! :wink:

### Why RoachPack?
Good question!
We are international students, visiting the United States for the first time. We all live near the Centinnial campus of NC State University.
Our eyes ready to take in the grandeur and technological advancements of the United States, we were rather welcomed by a group of Anthropods which we all are afraid of.
Yup, you guessed it right. Cockroaches!
To overcome this fear and to take on challenges, we have named our group **RoachPack**! :muscle:
